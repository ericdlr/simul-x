simul-x
=======

Simul-X is a simple IFR flight simulator in text mode ported to Xojo from a CP/M listing written by H. VIALARD-GOUDOU & G. PECONTAL and published in a french computing magazine in March 1984.

It's the reboot of a personnal work I did back in 1985 on a Lynx 48 Ko from Camputers Ltd (http://bit.ly/1RVuzhv). I was 15 at the time and it was my first real project.

  * The source code is available at github: https://github.com/ericdlr/simul-x
  * The original article in french is available at http://bit.ly/ms19840401.
    It may also be found in the simul-x/docs directory of the source code as a PDF file.

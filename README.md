simul-x
=======

A simple IFR flight simulator in text mode ported to Xojo from a CP/M listing written by H. VIALARD-GOUDOU &amp; G. PECONTAL and published in a french computing magazine in March 1984. The original article is available here: http://bit.ly/ms19840401 and in the simul-x/docs directory as a PDF file. It's written in French.

Simul-x is the reboot of a personnal work that I did back in 1985 on a Lynx 48 Ko from Camputers Ltd (http://bit.ly/1RVuzhv). I was 15 at that time and it was my first 'big' project.
